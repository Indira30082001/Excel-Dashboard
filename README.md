# Excel-Dashboard
Building My First Excel Dashboard â€“ A Fun Learning Experience!

Recently, I created a simple dashboard in Excel, and it turned out to be quite an interesting experience! ðŸŽ¯

Working on this project helped me understand data visualization, pivot tables, and conditional formatting in a hands-on way. I was able to transform raw data into interactive charts and insights, making the information much easier to analyze.

To share my experience, Iâ€™ve uploaded the project along with a screenshot of the dashboard in the GitHub.
